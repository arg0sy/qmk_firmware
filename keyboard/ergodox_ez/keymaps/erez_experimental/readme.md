# Erez's experimental layout

This is my personal layout which I use to test out ideas which may or may not make it onto the default layout we ship with. It's based off the default layout, with various tweaks.

Changelog:

## Jan 19, 2016:

* Made J into dual-action key (Alt when held down), to make Alt-tab more ergonomic.
* Made ' into dual-action key (Win/Cmd when held down).
